compression levels
hover over the image element in elements to see natural width and height

max-width: 100%
// is a good start to a responsive image, that won't grow pixelated.

2 images, side by side, with 10px middle margin
set width thusly
img {
  margin-right: 10px; // right image no margin of course
  max-width: 426px; // natural width
  width: calc((100% - 10px) / 2)
}

img:last-of-type {
  margin-right: 0;
}

//setup an image to responsively fit within contraints
img {
  width: 100vmin;
  height: 100vmin;
}

// cover entire viewport
img {
  width: 100vmax;
  height: 100vmax;
}

can use pageSpeedInsights to check for things you can compress, images, JS minification, etc
but Lighthouse is the better overall performance guide/test.
